# 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

# 1. Prerequisites
Flutter SDK installed.
A Firebase project configured (authentication, Firestore).
Ollama installed on your machine (required for running the local AI model).

# 2. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/eco-snap.git
cd eco-snap
```
# 3. Ollama Setup (AI Model)
The application requires an active Vision Language Model running via Ollama.
Download the Model: Pull the required model (e.g., Qwen 2.5-VL) using the terminal:
```
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:lastest
```
Start the Ollama Server: Run the Ollama server in a separate terminal window. The application communicates with this API.
```
ollama serve
```
# 4. Install Flutter Dependencies
```
flutter pub get
```
# 5. Configure Firebase
Place your google-services.json (Android) or GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) in the correct directories.
Update Firebase configuration in the code if necessary.

# 6. Run the Application
Ensure the Ollama server (ollama serve) is running before executing the Flutter app.
```
flutter run
```
